	<p class="normalsize"> My research focuses on graph data analysis. It borrows ideas from Topological Data Analysis,
    a recent field that aims at extracting and exploiting topological information out of complex data.
		More precisely, I work toward developing statistically well-founded and implementable methods to study graph structured data.

        The Central Limit Theorem indicates that a properly rescaled sum of random variables converges in distribution to a gaussian distribution.
        This is where the gaussian approximation problem arises :
        is it possible to draw these random variables, as well as a gaussian variable, such that the rescaled sum and the gaussian variable are close? <br>
        The presentation starts by a few reminders concerning standard probability results : law of large numbers, central limit theorem, Berry-Essen theorem, and quantile transformation.
        Then, historical results on gaussian approximation are presented.
        It includes, for the real case, the Skorokhod embedding and the Komlos Major and Tusnady (KMT) approach,
        as well as Zaitsev's results for the multidimensional case and Koltchinskii's results for general empirical processes.
        The end of this presentation concerns my thesis subject and its link with the gaussian approximation problem for random functions.
