  <h1>Research</h1>
	<p> My reshearch focuses on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a recent field which aims at extracting and exploiting topological information out of complex and possibly high dimensional data. 
		More precisely, I work toward developing statistically well-founded and implementable TDA methods to analyse graph structured data.
